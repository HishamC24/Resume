        <div id="box">
          Glassmorphism is a design trend that became popular around 2020, created by layering a semi-transparent/transluscent box with some
          background blur either on top of an image, or on top of a gradient or colorful background, which can be exaggerated by letting the box move
          around on top of said background to induce an even greater effect
          <br />
          <br />
          Recently, however, Apple introduced Liquid Glass, a type of "material" that warps the elements behind the box on the border of the box,
          which is very cumbersome to replicate on the web, and is also not as good and very rescource intensive, so I am not really bothering to even
          put an example of it here.
