          <p class="gray">
            “Excpute” is an 8 bit Central Processing Unit (CPU) programmed originally in Python, and currently in development on C++ and JavaScript.
            It features 8 registers, 3 dedicated to the Memory Address, Stack Pointer, and Flags. The CPU supports 32 different instructions,
            including ones dedicated to display manipulation. It supports a 256x256 display, with complete 8-bit color, as well as up to 256 8-bit
            ports, and a stack that utilizes part of memory, which is also 256 bytes. IO such as a keyboard and mouse inputs are completely
            functional.
            <br />
            <br />
            Alongside that I have made my own custom assembler for the CPU, to convert assembly made for the CPU into binaries that the CPU can
            process, complete with labels and variables.
            <br />
            <br />
            Currently, I am also planning on making a 16 bit version, with 256 different instructions.

          <p class="gray bold">February 2023 - March 2024</p>
          <p class="gray">
            Over the course of a year, I developed a text editor. It takes user input from a keyboard very similar to a 60% keyboard qwerty layout. It
            converts the input into an 8 bit number with a custom character set similar to ascii, stores it in a First In First Out (FIFO) queue, and
            each 8 bit character gets converted into a 5x7 image with a custom ROM. The character image then gets put into the next available spot on
            the display using a smart character detection system utilizing a signal bit.
            <br />
            <br />
            All of the mentioned above was created in Minecraft using Redstone with many months of research and development, and it is infinitely
            expandable to fit a large range of character counts.
